### Conclusions

The analysis suggests that rock is a key genre for free users, making it a prime opportunity for conversion efforts. Paid users exhibit higher engagement and retention, reinforcing the need for targeted promotions and referral incentives. Additionally, pop music is on a downward trend, requiring deeper analysis to understand shifting user preferences.

### Recommendations

To optimize user engagement and increase paid subscriptions, Fresh Beats should:

Leverage Rock's Popularity – Introduce free trials and exclusive content in rock to convert free users to paid.
Introduce Intermediate Pricing Tiers – Provide options between free and premium to make conversion easier.
Implement Referral Programs – Offer incentives such as free trials for users who refer new paid subscribers.
Expand Electronic & Hip-Hop Catalog – Attract more artists and offer time-limited promotions to boost engagement.
