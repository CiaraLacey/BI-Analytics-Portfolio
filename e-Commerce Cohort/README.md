# E-commerce Conversion & Retention Analysis


## Turning Raw User Event Logs into Actionable Business Metrics


Built a conversion funnel that tracks user interactions from product views to purchases, revealing a 10.3% total conversion rate.
Analyzed retention trends using cohort analysis, showing that only ~12.5% of users remain active after the first month.
Recommended strategies for improving conversion rates and long-term customer retention. 


### WHAT DID I BUILD AND WHY? 

This project analyzes raw user activity logs from an e-commerce website to provide data-driven insights into conversion rates and customer retention. The goal is to measure how effectively the site moves users through the sales funnel and to understand how long customers remain engaged after making their first purchase.

### WHAT PROBLEM DID I SOLVE? 

E-commerce businesses struggle to optimize their sales funnel and retain customers over time. This project identifies critical drop-off points in the purchasing process and tracks cohort retention rates to help executives make informed decisions on marketing and user engagement strategies

### WHAT TECHNOLOGIES DID I  USE?  

Google Sheets (Pivot Tables, VLOOKUP, TEXT, DATEDIF) – Data preparation and analysis.
Business Intelligence & Data Analytics – Conversion funnel and cohort analysis.
Spreadsheet Formatting & Documentation – Organizing data for stakeholder presentation.

### HOW MANY WEEKS/MONTHS DID IT TAKE TO COMPLETE?  

This project was completed in one week, covering data exploration, analysis, and report structuring.

### HOW MANY PEOPLE TOOK PART IN THE PROJECT AND WHAT WAS MY CONTRIBUTION?  

This was an individual project, where I was responsible for cleaning data, analyzing conversion rates and retention trends, and structuring the final report for stakeholders.
  
### Conclusions

The conversion funnel analysis revealed that only 29% of users who view a product add it to their cart, and only 35.6% of those complete the purchase. These drop-off points indicate potential friction in the checkout process. Additionally, retention analysis showed that user engagement declines rapidly after the first month, signaling a need for improved customer retention strategies.


### Recommendations

To increase conversion rates and improve customer retention, the company should:

Optimize the checkout experience – Reduce friction in the purchasing process to lower cart abandonment rates.
Implement re-engagement campaigns – Send targeted offers to users who abandon carts or stop purchasing.
Enhance loyalty programs – Encourage repeat purchases through discounts and exclusive member benefits.
Personalize product recommendations – Use user activity data to suggest relevant items and increase engagement.
